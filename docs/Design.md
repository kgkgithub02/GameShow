# Design

## Visual System

- Gradient backgrounds with high-contrast text
- Rounded cards and soft borders
- Emoji and Lucide icons for round identity
- Accent colors to reflect team identity and status

## Typography

- Large, bold headings for round titles
- Compact labels for metadata (category, points)
- Mobile adjustments reduce font size to avoid overflow

## Interaction Design

- Host controls round flow and scoring
- Players see compact round-specific screens
- Rules shown at the start of each round, then hidden
- Timer uses circular progress with color shift on low time
- Host menu is an overlay to keep the header clean

## Responsive Layout

- Mobile-first spacing and font sizing
- Scoreboard and round headers compressed on small screens
- Primary actions remain accessible without scrolling
